## Machine Learning Algorithms

:::: columns

::: {.column width="65%"}
This website is a comprehensive resource for machine learning algorithms. Here, you will find explanations of the most popular algorithms, as well as code implementations in Python.

The website is divided into two main sections: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms are used to learn from labeled data, while unsupervised learning algorithms are used to learn from unlabeled data.

## Building a Cat Image Classifier using Neural Networks from Scratch

:::: columns

::: {.column width="65%"}
This project showcases the implementation of deep learning algorithms from scratch for cat image classification using NumPy and SciPy in Python. 

The neural network architecture is developed within a Jupyter Notebook, emphasizing the creation of layers, activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid, and training procedures. 

Quarto is utilized to convert the notebook into a webpage, presenting an accessible overview of the custom-built deep learning algorithms employed in the classification of cat images.

## Neural Image Style Transfer using PyTorch

:::: columns

::: {.column width="65%"}
This project shows how we can use PyTorch to mix different artistic styles in images using something called neural image style transfer. It's like blending different painting styles onto different pictures. 

It talks about using pre-trained VGG19 models, which are like tools that help us understand images better. The notebook explains how to take out important details from images and define a way to measure how close or different two images are. Then, it uses these methods to slowly change one picture's style to look more like another picture.

This notebook is a good starting point for anyone interested in mixing different artistic styles in images. It helps to understand how images can be changed to look like different art styles by combining their content and artistic details.
