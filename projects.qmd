## Machine Learning Algorithms

:::: columns

::: {.column width="65%"}
This website is a comprehensive resource for machine learning algorithms. Here, you will find explanations of the most popular algorithms, as well as code implementations in Python.

The website is divided into two main sections: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms are used to learn from labeled data, while unsupervised learning algorithms are used to learn from unlabeled data.

## Building a Cat Image Classifier using Neural Networks from Scratch

:::: columns

::: {.column width="65%"}
This project showcases the implementation of deep learning algorithms from scratch for cat image classification using NumPy and SciPy in Python. 

The neural network architecture is developed within a Jupyter Notebook, emphasizing the creation of layers, activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid, and training procedures. 

Quarto is utilized to convert the notebook into a webpage, presenting an accessible overview of the custom-built deep learning algorithms employed in the classification of cat images.
